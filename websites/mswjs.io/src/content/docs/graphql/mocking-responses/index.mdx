Since GraphQL is still implemented over HTTP, you can handle an intercepted GraphQL operation in the [same ways](/docs/http/handling-requests) as you would any other HTTP request. This includes mocking the response, performing the operation as-is, or doing nothing.

This page will focus on responding to GraphQL operations with mocked responses. Explore the section on the left to find more fine-tuned mocking scenarios.

## Response declaration

When handling operations, GraphQL clients expect a JSON response of a predefined shape, including properties like `data`, `errors`, and others. You must respect that shape when constructing your mocked responses as well.

Use the `HttpResponse.json()` shorthand to respond to an intercepted GraphQL operation.

```ts {12-19} /HttpResponse/1 /HttpResponse.json/
import { graphql, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

const api = graphql.link('https://api.example.com/graphql')

type User = {
  id: string
  name: string
}

export const handlers = [
  api.query<User, { id: string }>('GetUser', ({ variables }) => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      data: {
        user: {
          id: variables.id,
          name: 'John Maverick',
        },
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

> Include the root-level keys like `data` or `errors` to tap into different GraphQL client response handling scenarios. Remember that GraphQL APIs support _partial responses_.

## Client-specific keys

Some GraphQL clients, like Apollo, require the presence of special keys in the response object to handle the associated operations correctly. You would have to include those keys in your mocked responses as well. Consult your GraphQL client documentation for more information on how it handles responses and whether it provides any helper functions to simplify the mocks declaration for you.

```ts {5}
api.query<User>('GetUser', () => {
  return HttpResponse.json({
    data: {
      user: {
        __typename: 'User',
        id: 'abc-123',
        name: 'John Maverick',
      },
    },
  })
})
```

> Above is an example of including the `__typename` key in the mocked response reqiured by Apollo.
