description: Intercepting any GraphQL operation.
---

You can intercept any GraphQL operation regardless of its kind by defining a `graphql.operation()` handler. Unlike query and mutation handlers, the operation handler does not require you to specify the operation kind or name, only the response resolver.

```ts /graphql.operation/ /() => {}/#g
graphql.operation(() => {})
```

> You can still access all the [Response resolver arguments](/docs/graphql/intercepting-operations/#response-resolver) of the intercepted GraphQL operation, like `operationName`, `variables`, etc.

This type of interception is handy when you want to delegate the request handling to an external source, like a mocked GraphQL schema. For that, see [Schema-first mocking](/docs/graphql/schema-first-mocking).
