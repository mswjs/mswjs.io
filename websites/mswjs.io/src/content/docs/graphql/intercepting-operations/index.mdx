On the web, GraphQL APIs are often implemented over HTTP. This means that, technically, you can still use the `http` namespace to intercept your GraphQL operations as regular HTTP requests. However, **it is recommended** to use the designated `graphql` namespace instead, as it provides a better developer experience and a richer feature-set when it comes to working with GraphQL.

This page will walk you through the possible ways to intercept a GraphQL operation with MSW.

## Endpoint-first mocking

By default, the library **ignores the servers endpoint** when matching GraphQL operations. That is a conscious decision since it is rare that a single application would interact with multiple GraphQL APIs. It means that the same handler will match a `GetUser` operation even if one is sent to `/api/graphql` and the other to `https://api.example.com`.

This default is supported for backward-compatibility, but it is **strongly recommended** to use [`graphql.link()`](/docs/api/graphql#graphqllinkurl) to scope GraphQL mocking to a particular server endpoint.

```ts {7,8} /graphql.link/
import { graphql } from 'msw'

const github = graphql.link('https://api.github.com/graphql')
const stripe = graphql.link('https://api.stripe.com/graphql')

export const handlers = [
  github.query('GetUser', oneResolver),
  stripe.query('GetUser', anotherResolver),
]
```

By defining GraphQL links, you tell MSW to take the server endpoint into account when performing operation matching.

## Operation kind

The library supports intercepting GraphQL queries and mutations (subscriptions support coming soon). Learn more about intercepting the operation kind you need:

</div>

You can also **intercept any GraphQL operation** regardless of its kind, which is handy in ambiguous contexts. Learn more about that approach on this page:

## Predicate

### Named operations

It is **not required but strongly recommended** to use **named GraphQL operations** when working with the library. Named operations will allow for easier interception since GraphQL mocking in MSW is operation-based and not field-based by default.

```graphql {5} /GetUser/
# The following GraphQL query can be handled
# with a handler that looks like this:
#
# graphql.query('GetUser', resolver)
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
  }
}
```

> You can opt to use field-based mocking by following the [Schema-first mocking](/docs/graphql/schema-first-mocking) recipe. Combining the two is also an option!

### Operation name

You can provide a _string_ as a request handler predicate that represents the name of the GraphQL operation you wish to intercept.

```ts /'GetUser'/
graphql.query('GetUser', () => {})
```

> This handler will match the following GraphQL query:
>
> ```graphql /GetUser/
> query GetUser {
>   user { ... }
> }
> ```

The same is true for mutations, just don't forget to use `graphql.mutation()` instead.

### Regular expression

You can provide a _regular expression_ as a request handler predicate. MSW will test the outgoing operation names against that expression to determine if they match.

```ts
graphql.mutation(/user/i, () => {})
```

> This handler will match both `CreateUser` and `UpdateUser` mutations.

### Custom predicate function

For more nuanced use cases, you can provide a function as the predicate. That function must return a `boolean` indicating whether the intercepted GraphQL query should match your request handler.

```ts
graphql.query(
  ({ operationType, operationName, query, variables, request, cookies }) => {
    // Match all GraphQL queries whose name includes "user".
    return operationName.toLowerCase().includes('user')
  },
  resolver,
)
```

> Note that your custom predicate function is called _after_ MSW parses the outgoing request as a valid GraphQL query. That way, you can access the query's information, like `query` and `variables`, without having to manually ensure the query validity.

## Response resolver

The following properties are available on the response resolver object argument for `graphql.*` handlers:

| Property        | Type                     | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cookies`       | `Record<string, string>` | Parsed request cookies.                                                                      |
| `query`         | `string`                 | Raw GraphQL [query string](/docs/graphql/intercepting-operations/queries#reading-raw-query). |
| `variables`     | `Record<string, any>`    | Parsed [variables](/docs/graphql/intercepting-operations/variables) of this operation.       |
| `operationName` | `string`                 | Operation name (e.g. `'GetUser'`).                                                           |

```ts /cookies/#g /query/ /variables/#v /operationName/
graphql.mutation(
  'UpdateUser',
  ({ cookies, query, variables, operationName }) => {},
)
```
