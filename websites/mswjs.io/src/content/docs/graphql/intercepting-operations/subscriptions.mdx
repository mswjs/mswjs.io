You can intercept a GraphQL subscription by defining a `graphql.subscription()` handler for it and matching it by its _operation (subscription) name_.

```ts /api.pubsub.handler/ /api.subscription/ /'OnCommendAdded'/#g
const api = graphql.link(url)

export const handlers = [
  api.pubsub.handler,
  api.subscription('OnCommendAdded', () => {}),
]
```
