Mock Service Worker comes with the first-class support for mocking [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs. You can develop, test, showcase, and debug your GraphQL applications using the `graphql` namespace exported by `msw`.

```ts
import { graphql } from 'msw'
```

## GraphQL clients

MSW supports intercepting any GraphQL operations that comply with the [GraphQL Specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/). This includes **queries and mutations** (subscriptions are coming in the future) regardless of the GraphQL client that performed them. The library has you covered if you're exploring GraphQL via `graphql-request` or plain `fetch()` as well as if you're using a production-ready client like Apollo, Relay, or URQL.

## Benefits

Here are some of the benefits when using MSW for mocking GraphQL:

- **No more `<MockProvider>`s!** Embrace a cleaner test setup to focus on what matters most: testing your app.
- **Specification-compliant**. The library will refuse operations that violate the spec, which adds an extra layer of implicit testing to your application (we literally use the `graphql` package to parse operations).
- **Client-agnostic**. You won't have to touch a single line of mocks if you migrate to a different GraphQL client.
- **Type-safe**. Reuse the type definitions you have from tools like [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) in your mocks. No more out-of-date mocks.
