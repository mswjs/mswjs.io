You can read the intercepted request's body as you normally would any Fetch API [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request). The `request` object you get in the response resolver argument is literally a regular `Request` instance and can be operated as such.

For example, you can call `await request.json()` to read the request's body as JSON:

```ts {2} /await request.json()/
http.post<{ id: string }, Post>('/posts/:id', async ({ request }) => {
  const newPost = await request.clone().json() // Post
})
```

<Success>
  It's highly recommended to _clone_ the intercepted request before reading its
  body. While it's okay to read the request body directly if you plan to mock
  its response, reading it without cloning in passthrough/bypass scenarios will
  result in an exception (streams cannot be read twice).
</Success>

The same is true for the other methods like `.text()`, `.formData()`, `.blob()`, etc.
