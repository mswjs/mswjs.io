You can mock a redirect response by constructing a valid redirect `Response` instance and returning it from the response resolver. This implies setting a redirect status code (`3xx`) and the `location` header that points to the destination URL.

```ts {3-6} /301/
http.get('/resource-a', () => {
  return new HttpResponse(null, {
    status: 301,
    headers: {
      location: '/resource-b',
    },
  })
})
```

> In this example, the `GET /resource-a` request will be redirected to `/resource-b`, which in this scenario is unhandled. You can define a request handler for it, too, and it will be matched as usual!
