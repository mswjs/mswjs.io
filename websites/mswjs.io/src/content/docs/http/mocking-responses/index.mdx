Responding to an intercepted request with a mocked response is one of the most common use cases for MSW. Note that it [isn't the only way to handle a request](/docs/http/handling-requests). This page will give you an overview of how to create mocked responses and use them in your request handlers.

## Fetch API limitations

When working with MSW, you will be using Fetch API [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) instances to describe mocked responses. Relying on a web standard allows for a familiar and flexible mocking experience, reusing of the existing network utilities, and transferable knowledge.

While you always write your mocks from the _server's perspective_, the Fetch API **isn't designed to declare server responses**. The API contains several restrictions that make sense on the client but less so in your mocks:

- Some response headers, like `Set-Cookie`, are [forbidden](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-response-header-name);
- Setting status codes outside of the `2xx`-`5xx` range are forbidden;

**None of these restrictions apply when mocking responses with MSW**. You can mock [cookies](/docs/http/mocking-responses/cookies), set otherwise non-configurable status codes, like `101 Switching Protocols`, and declare mocked responses as you would server responses. That is achieved by using the [`HttpResponse`](/docs/api/http-response) superset class provided by the library. Please prefer using it when declaring mocked responses.

## Responding to requests

### Return a mocked response

You can respond to an intercepted request with a mocked response by constructing the Fetch API `Response` instance you want and returning it from the response resolver.

```ts {5} /HttpResponse.text/
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get<never, never, string>('/resource', () => {
    return HttpResponse.text('hello world')
  }),
]
```

> You can return a plain Fetch API `Response` instance, too. It's recommended to use the [`HttpResponse`](/docs/api/http-response) class instead, which is a drop-in replacement for `Response` but provides improved developer experience and unlocks otherwise unavailable features, like mocking the `set-cookie` header.

### Throw a mocked response

If you throw a `Response` instance at any point in the response resolver, that response will be used as the mocked response for the request. This is particularly handy for short-circuiting the resolver flow anywhere during the request handling.

```ts /throw/ {3,8}
function withAuthorization(request: Request) {
  if (!request.headers.get('authorization')) {
    throw HttpResponse.text('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }
}

http.get<never, never, { id: string }>('/resource', ({ request }) => {
  withAuthorization(request)
  return HttpResponse.json({ id: 'abc-123' })
})
```

> In this example, the `GET /resource` request will get a "401 Unauthorized" response if it doesn't contain the `Authorization` header. Otherwise, it will proceed with the mocked JSON response.

## Response declaration

It is highly recommended you get yourself familiar with Fetch API [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) class. Mocking various response scenarios will come down to declaring them using that standard class. Below, you can find a few common examples. Make sure to explore the section to your left for more advanced use cases.

### Status code

```ts /status/
http.get('/resource', () => {
  return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 404 })
})
```

### Response headers

```ts {4-8} /headers/
http.get('/resource', () => {
  return HttpResponse.json(
    { id: 'abc-123' },
    {
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'application/hal+json',
      },
    },
  )
})
```

### Response body

You can use all the supported response body types, like strings, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `FormData`, `URLSearchParams`, and `ReadableStream` as the body of your mocked response.

```ts {2} /.text/
http.get('/resource', () => {
  return HttpResponse.text('hello world')
})
```

> Learn more about the static shorthand methods like `.text()`, `.json()`, and others in the [`HttpResponse` API reference](/docs/api/http-response).
