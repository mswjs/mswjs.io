You can combine original and mocked responses using a technique called **response patching**. It involves performing the intercepted request as-is, getting its original response, and modifying it as you want.

Use the [`bypass()`](/docs/api/bypass) function from `msw` to perform any Fetch API `Request`, bypassing any otherwise matching request handlers and also preventing an infinite loop caused by the handler where you're using `bypass()`:

```ts {4-5,8-10} /bypass/
import { http, HttpResponse, bypass } from 'msw'

http.get('/resource', async ({ request }) => {
  // Get the original JSON response from the server.
  const originalData = await bypass(request).then((response) => response.json())

  return HttpResponse.json({
    // Combine the original data with the mocked data.
    ...originalData,
    id: 'mocked-id',
  })
})
```
