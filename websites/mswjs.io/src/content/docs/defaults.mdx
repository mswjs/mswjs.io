## Default passthrough

MSW embraces a network-first approach, which means that it will not interfere with the network unless you explicitly say so in your handlers.

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Intercepting WebSockets, however, is _mock-first_ due to the limitations of
  their specification.
</Warning>

## Handler fallthrough

Every intercepted request "falls through" the list of your handlers, looking for the first matching handler to return an [instruction](/docs/http/handling-requests) on how to handle the request (mock response, response-patch, passthrough, do nothing). A single request may match _multiple handlers_ at the same time but only _one handler_ can be responsible for handling it.

```ts {5}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('One')),
  http.get('/user', () => HttpResponse.json({ name: 'John' })),
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('Three')),
]
```

> In the example above, given an outgoing `GET /user` request, you will see the `"One"` string printed to the console and then receive the mocked JSON response as defined in the second handler. You _will not_ see the `"Three"` string because the third handler is never reached (i.e. request already handled).

You can use fallthrough to a great effect to layer your network behaviors. See [Network behavior overrides](/docs/best-practices/network-behavior-overrides).

## Handler order sensitivity

Derived from the fallthrough behavior, handlers are sensitive to the order in which they are defined. MSW executes them left-to-right, starting from handler overrides, if any, since those are prepended to the list of handlers.

```ts {5-7,14}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('One')),
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('Two')),
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('Three')),
]

const server = setupServer(...handlers)
server.listen()

server.use(
  http.get('/user', () => console.log('Override one')),
)
```

Given an outgoing `GET /user` request, this is what you will see in the console:

```
Override one
One
Two
Three
```

> The request itself will be performed as-is according to the default passthrough since none of the handlers above has handled it.

Use the handler order sensitivity to differentiate between ambiguous request matches:

```js /messages/2 /*/2 {6}
export const handlers = [
  // By placing a more specific request predicate first,
  // the "GET /user/messages" request will be handled
  // properly, despite it also matching a more permissive
  // "/user/*" handler below.
  http.get('/user/messages', messagesResolver)
  http.get('/user/*', resolverOne),
]
```
