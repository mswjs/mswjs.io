You can send data to the intercepted WebSocket client by calling `client.send()` anywhere in the `connection` event listener:

```ts /client.send/
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ client }) => {
  client.send('hello from server!')
})
```

> You can send text, `Blob`, and `ArrayBuffer` to the client.

This will send the given data **to the particular `client`**, and it will receive and handle it as if it was received from the server. For sending data to multiple clients, see [broadcasting data](/docs/websocket/client-events/broadcasting-data).

## Examples

### Sending text

```ts {2}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ client }) => {
  client.send('hello world')
})
```

### Sending `Blob`

```ts {2}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ client }) => {
  client.send(new Blob(['hello world'], { type: 'text/plain' }))
})
```

### Sending `ArrayBuffer`

```ts {2}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ client }) => {
  client.send(new TextEncoder().encode('hello world'))
})
```
