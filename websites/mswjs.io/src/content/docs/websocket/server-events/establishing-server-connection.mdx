title: Establishing server connection
---

By default, MSW **does not establish a WebSocket connection to the actual server**. You can, however, establish such a connection at any point in your event handler by calling `server.connect()`.

```ts {5}
const api = ws.link('wss://api.example.com')

export const handlers = [
  api.addEventListener('connection', ({ server }) => {
    server.connect()
  }),
]
```

In the example above, `server.connect()` will establish a new, bypassed WebSocket connection to the underlying WebSocket URL (`'wss://api.example.com'`).

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Just like establishing connections with `new WebSocket()`, you do _not_ have
  to await the `server.connect()` call.

## Managing the connection

Once you establish the connection, the `server` object becomes your point of entry to managing the said connection. For example, you can listen to the original connection erroring by adding an `error` listener to the `server` object:

```ts {2}
server.connect()
server.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  // Handle the original connection error.
})
```

## Event forwarding

Bear in mind that once the original server connection has been established, all the server events will be forwarded to the client, and all the client events will be forwarded to the original server. Learn how to manage that forwarding:
