Once you establish the actual server connection by calling `server.connect()`, your event handler can start sending mock data to the original server via the `server.send()` method.

```ts {3}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ server }) => {
  server.connect()
  server.send('hello world')
})
```

> `server.send()` has the same call signature as supported data types as `client.send()`.

This is handy for triggering a particular server behavior by emulating a client-sent event (including those the client hasn't sent).
