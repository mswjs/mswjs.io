Once you establish the actual server connection by calling `server.connect()`, all the server events will be forwarded to the client, and all the client events will be forwarded to the original server. In this sense, your event handler becomes a proxy sitting in-between the two.

You can manage that event forwarding in multiple ways:

- Proxy the events (i.e. do nothing);
- Send modified server events to the client;
- Prevent server events from reaching the client entirely.

## Preventing server events

You can prevent any event received from the original server by calling `event.preventDefault()` in the respective event listener.

```ts {5}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ server }) => {
  server.connect()

  server.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
  })
})
```

For example, here we are preventing any `message` events from ever reaching the WebSocket client. You are still able to observe the received message events in the listener but they will not be forwarded to the client anymore.

> Since the server-to-client event forwarding is the _default_ behavior in MSW, all you have to do to opt out from it is call `event.preventDefault()`.

Just like with regular events, you can prevent the default _conditionally_:

```ts {4-6}
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ server }) => {
  server.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    // Skip forwarding only for particular server messages.
    if (event.data === 'hello world') {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  })
})
```

## Modifying server events

Modifying a server event comes down to two steps:

1. Preventing the forwarding for that event (i.e. `event.preventDefault()`);
1. Sending a modified (mocked) event to the client instead (i.e. `client.send()`).

Let's expand on the previous example and send a modified server event after it's been prevented:

```ts {5} /client/
api.addEventListener('connection', ({ server, client }) => {
  server.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    if (event.data === 'hello world') {
      event.preventDefault()
      client.send('goodbye cosmos')
    }
  })
})
```
