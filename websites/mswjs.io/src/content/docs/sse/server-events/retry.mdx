You can mock the reconnection time instruction from the server by sending the [`retry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#retry) message to the client. The value of the `retry` key will control the reconnection time if the underlying connection is lost.

```ts {5}
import { sse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  sse('/stream', ({ client }) => {
    client.send({ retry: 1000 })
  }),
]
```

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  If present, the `retry` key must be the only key on the object provided to
  `client.send()`. All the other keys will be ignored.
</Warning>

This will result in the following message received by the client:

```
retry:1000

```
