You can send a mock message event to the client by calling `client.send()` and providing it with the message data:

```ts {5}
import { sse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  sse('/stream', ({ client }) => {
    client.send({ data: 'hello world' })
  }),
]
```

> Providing an explicit `event: 'message'` has no effect and is equivalent to not providing the `event` property at all.

This will result in the following message received by the client:

```
data:hello world

```
