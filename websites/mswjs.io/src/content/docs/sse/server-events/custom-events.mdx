You can specify the custom event type by providing the `event` key on the client message:

```ts {6}
import { sse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  sse('/stream', ({ client }) => {
    client.send({
      event: 'greeting',
      data: 'hello world',
    })
  }),
]
```

This will result in the following message received by the client:

```
event:greeting
data:hello world

```
