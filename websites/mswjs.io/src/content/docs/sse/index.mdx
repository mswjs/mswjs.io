Mock Service Worker ships with a first-class API for intercepting and mocking [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) (SSE) via the `sse` namespace provided by the library:

```ts
import { sse } from 'msw'
```

import { PageCard } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/pageCard'
import { CubeTransparentIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'

<PageCard
  icon={CubeTransparentIcon}
  url="/docs/api/sse"
  title="sse"
  description="API reference for the `sse` namespace."
/>

## Difference from `http`

The stream of server events is still a regular HTTP connection, which means you can intercept and mock with the `http` namespace as you would any other HTTP request:

```ts {5-10} /stream/2,3
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/stream', ({ request }) => {
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode('data: Hello World\n\n'))
        controller.close()
      },
    })

    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'text/event-stream',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

Handling SSE via the `http` namespace, however, has a number of disadvantages:

- You have to manually construct the stream;
- You have to encode sent messages and make sure they adhere to the standard;

In comparison, the `sse` namespace provides you a type-safe, high-level experience of working with SSE:

```ts {5,8} /sse/
import { sse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  sse<{ message: string }>('/stream', ({ client }) => {
    client.send({ data: 'hello world' })

    queueMicrotask(() => {
      client.close()
    })
  }),
]
```

The implementation details of the comnunication, such as managing the stream and queuing messages, are abstracted away, allowing you to focus on describing the network behavior you want. The `sse` namespace also enables additional feature otherwise unavailable when working with `EventSource` directly, such as forwarding of the original server events with ambiguous names.
