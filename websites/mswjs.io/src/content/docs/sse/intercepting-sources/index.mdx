description: Intercepting and handling event sources
---

You can intercept any `EventSource` in your applicatio by defining a request handler for it using the `sse` namespace. For example, consider this event source:

```ts
new EventSource('https://api.example.com/events')
```

Intercept it by its URL and start handling the connection:

```ts
import { sse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  sse('https://api.example.com/events', ({ request, client, server }) => {
    console.log(request.url)
  }),
]
```
