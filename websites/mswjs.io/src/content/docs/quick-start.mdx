This guide will take you through the barebones setup of MSW for intercepting HTTP requests in **your Node.js tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**.

## 1. Installation

```
npm i msw --save-dev
```

## 2. Request handlers

Import the `http` namespace from the `msw` package and create your first _request handler_. Those are functions responsible for intercepting requests and handling their responses.

Let's define a request handler for a `GET https://api.example.com/user` request:

```ts {5-11} /http/1,2
// src/mocks/handlers.ts
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('https://api.example.com/user', () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      id: 'abc-123',
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Maverick',
    })
  }),
]
```

> MSW supports intercepting both [HTTP](/docs/http), [GraphQL](/docs/graphql), and [WebSocket](/docs/websocket) APIs.

## 3. Process-level integration

One of the core benefits of MSW is the ability to reuse the same mocks (e.g. `handlers.ts`) across different tools and environments. On their own, request handlers don't do anything. They have to be provided to the `setupServer` or `setupWorker` functions to configure API mocking in a Node.js or a browser process, respectively.

Since Vitest tests run in a Node.js process, let's use `setupServer` from `msw/node` and create a `node.ts` integration point:

```ts /setupServer/1,2 /handlers/1,3#v
// src/mocks/node.ts
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers.ts'

export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

> This integration has nothing specific to Vitest. You can reuse it to apply MSW to any Node.js process.

## 4. Tool-level integration

At this step, you find the appropriate place to enable API mocking in your Node.js process. In the case of Vitest, that place is the _test setup_ file, which runs before your tests. Open that file (or create it) and call `server.listen()` in enable mocking as follows:

```ts /server/
// vitest.setup.ts
import { beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll } from 'vitest'
import { server } from './mocks/node.ts'

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

> Make sure you have the `vitest.setup.ts` module listed in the `test.setupFiles` array in your `vitest.config.ts`.

## 5. Run tests

Once MSW is integrated into your Vitest setup, it will control the network as defined in your handlers.

```ts
// test/example.test.ts
// @vitest-environment node
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

test('responds with the user', async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')

  await expect(response.json()).resolves.toEqual({
    id: 'abc-123',
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Maverick',
  })
})
```

```
npx vitest
```

```

## Usage examples

MSW applies on the environment level (Node.js or browser). Integrating it with different tools will come down to finding the appropriate environment entrypoint provided to you by that tool and following the same setup as you did above.

For reference, we've prepared a curated collection of usage examples:
