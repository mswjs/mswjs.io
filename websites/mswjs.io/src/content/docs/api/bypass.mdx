## Call signature

The same as the `globalThis.fetch()` function, the `bypass` function expects two arguments: `RequestInput` and `RequestInit`. It returns a _tuple_ of modified input and init arguments to then be provided on the regular `globalThis.fetch()` call.

```ts
function bypass(input: RequestInput, init?: RequestInit): Request {}
```

## Usage

This method is designed to perform HTTP requests outside of the library's interception algorithm. Requests performed via `bypass()` _will never be intercepted_, even if there are otherwise matching request handlers present in the network description. This special behavior enables more complex network scenarios, such as [Response patching](/docs/http/mocking-responses/response-patching):

```js /bypass/1,3 {7}
import { http, bypass, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/user', async ({ request }) => {
    // Perform the intercepted "GET /user" request as-is
    // by passing its "request" reference to the "bypass" function.
    const response = await fetch(bypass(request))
    const realUser = await response.json()

    // Return a mocked JSON response by patching the original response
    // together with a mocked data.
    return HttpResponse.json({
      ...realUser,
      lastName: 'Maverick',
    })
  }),
]
```

<Info>
  You can use `bypass()` anywhere in your application/tests, it's not limited to
  the response resolver.
</Info>

Unlike [`passthrough()`](/docs/api/passthrough), the `bypass()` function _results in an additional request being made_. You can think of it as a server requesting additional resources while handling a request. Because of this, `bypass()` must not be used when all you wish is to perform the intercepted request as-is (use `passthrough()` in that case).
