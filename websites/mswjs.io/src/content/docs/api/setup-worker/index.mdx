The `setupWorker()` function prepares the client-worker communication channel to enable API mocking in the browser.

## Call signature

The `setupWorker()` function expects an optional list of [Request handlers](/docs/http/intercepting-requests) spread as its arguments and returns a [Worker instance](#worker-instance).

When called without any arguments, the function will return you a worker instance that has no network description (i.e. no request handlers). Use the methods like [`worker.use()`](/docs/api/setup-worker/use) and [`worker.resetHandlers()`](/docs/api/setup-worker/reset-handlers) to add and remove _runtime_ request handlers to the worker instance.

```js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'

const worker = setupWorker()
// worker.start()
// worker.use(...handlers)
```

However, if you provide request handlers as the spread argument to the `setupWorker()` function, those handlers will be considered _initial_ and will always persist on the worker instance even when resetting the handlers (learn how to opt-out from this [here](/docs/api/setup-worker/reset-handlers)).

```js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'

const worker = setupWorker(
  http.get('/resource', () => HttpResponse.json({ id: 'abc-123' })),
)
```

## Worker instance

The `setupWorker()` function returns you a _worker instance_ that is an object you can use to control API mocking in the current browser environment. Below, you can see the list of methods available on the worker instance.

### Methods

- [`start(options)`](/docs/api/setup-worker/start)
- [`stop()`](/docs/api/setup-worker/stop)
- [`use(...handlers)`](/docs/api/setup-worker/use)
- [`resetHandlers(...handlers)`](/docs/api/setup-worker/reset-handlers)
- [`restoreHandlers()`](/docs/api/setup-worker/restore-handlers)
- [`listHandlers()`](/docs/api/setup-worker/list-handlers)
  - The `.printHandlers()` method on `worker`/`server` has been removed in favor of the new `.listHandlers()` method.
