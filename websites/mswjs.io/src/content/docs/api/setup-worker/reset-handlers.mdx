## Call signature

The `worker.resetHandlers()` method can be called without any arguments. When done so, all the [Runtime request handlers](/docs/concepts/request-handler#runtime-request-handler) (those prepended via `worker.use()`) will be removed.

```js {4}
const worker = setupWorker(http.get("/resource", resolver));
worker.use(http.post("/user", resolver));

worker.resetHandlers();
// The "POST /user" runtime request handler is removed,
// and only the "GET /resource" initial request handler remains.
```

The `worker.resetHandlers()` method also accepts an optional list of request handlers spread as its arguments. When such a list is provided, the initial request handlers passed to `setupWorker()` will also be removed, and the given list of request handlers would act as the initial handlers.

```js
const worker = setupWorker(http.get("/resource", resolver));
worker.use(http.post("/user", resolver));

worker.resetHandlers(http.patch("/book/:bookId", resolver));
// Both the runtime "POST /user" and the initial "GET /resource"
// request handlers are removed, and only the "PATCH /book/:bookId"
// request handler remains.
```

## How it works

The `resetHandlers` method resets the currently active request handlers. When the worker is initialized using [`setupWorker`](/docs/api/setup-worker/#call-signature), the handlers provided via the spread argument are stored in `this.initialHandlers` and also assigned to `this.handlers`.

```js
// worker.resetHandlers
public resetHandlers(
  ...nextHandlers: Array<RequestHandler | WebSocketHandler>
): void {
  this.handlersController.reset(nextHandlers);
}

// this.handlersController.reset
public reset(
  nextHandlers: Array<RequestHandler | WebSocketHandler>
): void {
  this.handlers = nextHandlers.length > 0
    ? [...nextHandlers]
    : [...this.initialHandlers];
}
```

Handlers added via `worker.use` are appended only to `this.handlers` without modifying `this.initialHandlers`.

Calling `resetHandlers` without arguments restores the handlers to `this.initialHandlers`, whereas calling it with arguments replaces the current handlers with the provided ones.

The [SetupApi.ts](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/blob/main/src/core/SetupApi.ts) file defines the core API for initializing and managing request handlers in MSW, including functions for adding, resetting, and restoring handlers.
