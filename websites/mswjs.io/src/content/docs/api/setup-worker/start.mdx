description: Register the Service Worker and starts the request interception.

## Call signature

The `worker.start()` method accepts an optional [Options](#options) object that you can use to customize the worker registration.

By default, when called without any arguments, the `worker.start()` method registers the Service Worker served under `./mockServiceWorker.js` and starts the request interception.

```js {5}
import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
await worker.start() // Promise<{ pending }>
```

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Note that registering and activating the Service Worker is an asynchronous
  action. The `worker.start()` returns you a promise that resolves when the
  worker is ready. Do not forget to await it to prevent race conditions between
  the worker registration and your network-dependent code.
</Warning>

You can see a confirmation message printed in the browser's console when MSW is active.

```sh
[MSW] Mocking enabled.
```

## Options

### `serviceWorker`

#### `url`

- _String_, default: `"/mockServiceWorker.js"`

Custom Service Worker registration URL. Use this option if you are serving the worker script under a custom path.

```js
worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    url: '/assets/mockServiceWorker.js',
  },
})
```

<Warning>
  Keep in mind that a Service Worker can only control the network from the
  clients (pages) hosted at its level or down. You likely always want to
  register the worker at the root.
</Warning>

#### `options`

- [_Service Worker registration options_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register#parameters)

These options modify the Service Worker registration itself and are not related to MSW directly.

```js
worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    options: {
      // Narrow down the scope of the pages that the worker can control.
      scope: '/product',
    },
  },
})
```

### `findWorker`

- _Function_, expected return type: _Boolean_

A custom function to locate the worker script on the server. You may want to use this option if your application runs behind a proxy or has a dynamic hostname that otherwise prevents the library from locating the worker script at `<HOSTNAME>/mockServiceWorker.js`.

```js
worker.start({
  findWorker(scriptUrl, mockServiceWorkerUrl) {
    return scriptUrl.includes('mockServiceWorker')
  },
})
```

### `quiet`

- _Boolean_, default: `false`

Disables all the logging from the library (e.g. the activation message, the intercepted requests' messages).

```js
worker.start({
  quiet: true,
})
```

### `onUnhandledRequest`

- _String_, default: `"warn"`
- _Function_

Decide how to react to unhandled requests (i.e. those that do not have a matching request handler).

#### Predefined strategies

| Handling mode    | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `warn` (Default) | Prints a warning message to the browser's console, performs the request as-is. |
| `error`          | Throws an error, aborts the request.                                           |
| `bypass`         | Prints nothing, performs the request as-is.                                    |

#### Custom strategy

```js
worker.start({
  onUnhandledRequest(request, print) {
    // Ignore any requests containing "cdn.com" in their URL.
    if (request.url.includes('cdn.com')) {
      return
    }

    // Otherwise, print an unhandled request warning.
    print.warning()
  },
})
```

> By default, MSW will ignore common static asset requests so they won't be considered unhandled. If you provide a custom callback to the `onUnhandledRequest` function, _you will opt out from that behavior_. You can tap into it at any time by manually calling the [`isCommonAssetRequest()`](/docs/api/is-common-asset-request) function.

### `waitUntilReady`

- _Boolean_, default: `true`

Defers any application requests that happen during the Service Worker registration.

<Warning>
  Disabling this option is **not recommended** as this will create a race
  condition between the worker registration and your application's runtime.
</Warning>
