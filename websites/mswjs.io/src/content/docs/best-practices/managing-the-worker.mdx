title: Managing the worker
---

In the browser, MSW registers a Service Worker script (`mockServiceWorker.js`) that allows it to intercept the outgoing network traffic of your application. Below, learn about the best practices of generating, verifying, and updating the worker script.

## Generating the worker script

To generate the worker script, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR> --save
```

You'd have to replace the `<PUBLIC_DIR>` part with the actual path to your application's public directory. You can learn more about this step here:

import { PageCard } from '../../../components/react/pageCard'
import { CommandLineIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'

<PageCard
  icon={CommandLineIcon}
  url="/docs/cli/init#--save"
  title="`init` CLI command"
  description="Generate the worker script at the given path."
/>

## Committing the worker script

**It is recommended you commit the `mockServiceWorker.js` worker script in Git**. This way, everyone working on the project can get MSW up and running without having to run any additional commands.

Alternatively, you can treat the worker script as a generated artifact. If you chose to do so, make sure to automate the [worker script generation](#generating-the-worker-script) so the script is created for everyone starting with the project.

## Serving the worker script

The entire point of `msw init` is to copy the worker script to your project's root directory so _it is available on runtime_. You must ensure that your application is serving the worker script correctly by opening the script's URL in the browser.

For example, if you are running your application at `http://localhost:3000`, navigating to `http://localhost:3000/mockServiceWorker.js` must return the `application/javascript` content of the worker script. If it doesn't, you should repeat the [generation step](#generating-the-worker-script) or go through the browser integration from the start:

import { Bars2Icon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'

<PageCard
  icon={Bars2Icon}
  url="/docs/integrations/browser"
  title="Browser integration"
  description="Set up Mock Service Worker in the browser."
/>

## Updating the worker script

The client-side code of MSW can pick up any worker script within the same major version. It is still recommended to keep the worker script up-to-date with the installed version of MSW. That is why we recommend using the `--save` flag with the `msw init` command.

When run with the `--save` flag, the `msw init` command will save the used public path in `package.json`. Later, whenever you upgrade or downgrade the `msw` dependency, it will automatically generate the worker script at the saved path to keep you in-sync.

```json {3-5}
// package.json
{
  "msw": {
    "workerDirectory": "./public"
  }
}
```

  url="/docs/cli/init#--save"
  title="`--save` flag of the `init` command"
  description="Save the public directory to enable automatic updates."
/>

### Multiple worker directories

MSW supports an array of public directories as the value of the `msw.workerDirectory` property. This is especially handy when using MSW in multiple packages in a monorepo.

```json {5-9}
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo-root",
  "msw": {
    "workerDirectory": [
      // Include multiple public directories.
      "./packages/one/public",
      "./packages/two/static"
    ]
  }
}
```

Anytime you run `msw init` with the `--save` flag and a public directory not previously stored in `msw.workerDirectory`, MSW will automatically save the new public directory in your `package.json`.

> If you decide to manually edit `msw.workerDirectory`, make sure that it's set in <em>your project's root-level `package.json`</em>.
