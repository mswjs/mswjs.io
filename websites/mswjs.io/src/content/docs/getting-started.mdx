description: Three steps to get started with Mock Service Worker.

Developers use MSW for many things: to mock APIs in testing, to debug network while developing, to present their work across teams, to monitor the outgoing traffic, etc. Writing a single tutorial that would suit all those use cases is rather difficult. There's good news, however. Working with MSW follows the same flow, no matter how and where you decide to use it.

Below, you can find a complete, barebones tutorial that integrates MSW in a Node.js application. Please note that this tutorial is intended as a working reference, and you are encouraged to follow the additional links in each of the sections below to achieve the integration you want.

## Step 1: Install

Install MSW as a dependency by running the following command in your project:

```sh
npm install msw@latest --save-dev
```

> If you need to, you can also [install MSW from a CDN](/docs/recipes/using-cdn).

## Step 2: Describe

Next, you describe the network using [Request handlers](/docs/concepts/request-handler) (e.g. `http.get()`, `graphql.query()`). A request handler is responsible for [intercepting a request](/docs/basics/intercepting-requests) and [handling its response](/docs/basics/mocking-responses), which can be a mocked response, a combination of the real response and a mock, or nothing, if you only want to monitor the traffic without affecting it.

In this tutorial, let's define a single HTTP request handler for a `GET https://example.com/user` request and respond to it with a mocked JSON response.

```js /http/1,3 /HttpResponse/#v
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  // Intercept "GET https://example.com/user" requests...
  http.get('https://example.com/user', () => {
    // ...and respond to them using this JSON response.
    return HttpResponse.json({
      id: 'c7b3d8e0-5e0b-4b0f-8b3a-3b9f4b3d3b3d',
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Maverick',
    })
  }),
]
```

> Start small with a single `handlers.js` module that contains the entire network description. With time, you can [restructure your handlers](/docs/best-practices/structuring-handlers) and learn how to [override them on runtime](/docs/best-practices/network-behavior-overrides).

You can describe different APIs, like REST or GraphQL, including at the same time in the same `handlers` array. **Learn more about describing server APIs with MSW:**

import { PageCard } from '../../components/react/pageCard'
import { NodejsIcon } from '../../components/react/icons/nodejs'
import { GraphQLIcon } from '../../components/react/icons/graphql'

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
  <PageCard
    icon={NodejsIcon}
    url="/docs/http"
    title="Describing REST API"
    description="Learn about describing RESTful APIs."
  />
  <PageCard
    icon={GraphQLIcon}
    url="/docs/graphql"
    title="Describing GraphQL API"
    description="Learn about describing GraphQL APIs."
  />
</div>

> You can make the most out of MSW by annotating your request handlers [using TypeScript](/docs/best-practices/typescript). This is particularly handy when you have type definitions generated by your actual API, be it an OpenAPI document or GraphQL Code Generator.

## Step 3: Integrate

MSW integrates with any frameworks, request libraries, and other tools because it applies itself on the environment level, which means you only have to decide whether you want to use it in the browser or in a Node.js process (or both). You still (re)use the same request handlers regardless of the environment you are in.

For this tutorial, let's integrate MSW into a plain Node.js process by creating a Node.js integration module called `node.js`:

```js /setupServer/
// src/mocks/node.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

> We recommend creating environment-dependent integration modules, like `node.js` and `browser.js`, so you can reuse the same integrations across different tools. Any tooling in JavaScript runs either in the browser (actual browsers, Playwright, Cypress, Storybook) or in Node.js (Vitest, Jest, React Native). Pull in the right integration based on your tool's environment, and you are all set.

The `node.js` integration module we've created configures MSW to run in any Node.js process **but doesn't actually start it just yet**. To start the request interception, you need to call `server.listen()` in your Node.js process:

```js /server/ {5}
// src/index.js
import { server } from './mocks/node'

server.listen()

// This is a simple Node.js application that
// does a network request and prints the response.
async function app() {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/user')
  const user = await response.json()
  console.log(user)
}

app()
```

> You can also start MSW conditionally, based on `process.env.NODE_ENV` or any other criteria.

Running the application will now print the mocked response without actually making a network request:

```txt {3-7}
node ./src/index.js

{
  id: 'c7b3d8e0-5e0b-4b0f-8b3a-3b9f4b3d3b3d',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Maverick'
}
```

## Examples

In the repository below, you can find the functional, complete, and minimalistic examples of how to use Mock Service Worker with tools like Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright, Angular, Svelte, Remix, and others. Use them as a reference whenever integrating MSW with those tools.
