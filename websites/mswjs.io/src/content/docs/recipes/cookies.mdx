## Read request cookies

You can access the intercepted request cookies using the `cookies` argument of the response resolver:

```js /cookies/ {5}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/api/user', ({ cookies }) => {
    if (!cookies.authToken) {
      return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 403 })
    }

    return HttpResponse.json({ name: 'John' })
  }),
]
```

> Note that the value of `cookies` respects [Request credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials), and may contain more data than originally sent in the request (e.g. when the `credentials` property of the request was set to `"include"`).

## Mock response cookies

Mocking response cookies is often challenging because the Fetch specification [forbids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) setting `Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2` headers on manually constructed responses for security reasons.

Since Mock Service Worker executes on the client, it can work around this limitation by setting mocked response cookies directly on the `document.cookie`, as if they were received from the server. This approach doesn't compromise response security while still allowing you to test your application's cookie handling logic.

```js {6-11}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.post('/login', () => {
    return new HttpResponse(null, {
      headers: {
        // Setting the "Set-Cookie" mocked response header
        // will forward these cookies onto "document" as if they
        // were sent from the server.
        'Set-Cookie': 'authToken=abc-123',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

> Note that you must use the [`HttpResponse`](/docs/api/http-response) class in order to set mocked response cookies. This way MSW can detect response cookies because they cannot be accessed in JavaScript once set.
