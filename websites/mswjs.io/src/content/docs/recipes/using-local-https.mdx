Due to security considerations, Service Workers can only be registered over a secure connection (exception being the local development on `localhost`). In some project setups, you may require to run your local application over HTTPS and will shortly encouter the following error when starting MSW's worker:

```txt
SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker:
  An SSL certificate error occurred when fetching the script.
```

This error occurs because your browser will not trust your self-signed certificate. As a result of it, the browser will block the Service Worker registration attempt and MSW will not work.

To use the library with a local HTTPS setup you must make your browser trust your self-signed certificate. This can be achieve in multiple ways described below.

## Trust certificate on system level

You can add your self-signed certificate to the system's trusted certificates. Please refer to the respective resources online on how to do so based on your operating system.

## Trust certificate on browser level

### Chrome / Brave

1. Open `chrome://flags` (or `brave://flags` if using Brave);
1. Search for `unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` flag in the list;
1. Select the "Enabled" option next to the flag.
1. Enter your local host into the field.

> If encountering certificate fetching/validation issues, set the `ignore-certificate-errors` flag to "Enabled".

### Firefox

1. Open your local application served by HTTPS;
1. On the "Connection is not secure" screen click the "Advanced" button;
1. In the section below, click the "Add Exception" button.
1. Specify your application's URL as the "Location" input value;
1. Click the "Confirm Security Exception" button.

### Safari

We are not aware of any settings to make Safari trust self-signed certificates. Consider enabling [System-wide trust](#trust-certificate-on-system-level) on MacOS instead.
