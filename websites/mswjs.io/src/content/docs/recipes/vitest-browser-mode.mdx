[Vitest Browser Mode](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/browser/) is a fantastic tool for testing your UI components in the actual browser. There are a few things to consider when integrating MSW with the Browser Mode:

- As the name suggests, your Browser Mode tests run _in the actual browser_. This means you will be using the [Browser integration](/docs/integrations/browser) of MSW (i.e. `setupWorker()`);
- You cannot reuse the app-level integration (e.g. in your `main.tsx`) because you don't normally render your entire component tree during component testing. You can still rely on that integration for local development with MSW though;
- Vitest actually ships with MSW built-in, however, as of the time writing this, you cannot directly access the `worker` instance created by Vitest. This may change in the future.

## Example

We recommend integrating MSW with Vitest Browser Mode by [extending the test context](https://vitest.dev/guide/test-context.html#extend-test-context).

```ts {6-23}
// test-extend.ts
import { test as testBase } from 'vitest'
import { worker } from './mocks/browser.js'

export const test = testBase.extend({
  worker: [
    async ({}, use) => {
      // Start the worker before the test.
      await worker.start()

      // Expose the worker object on the test's context.
      await use(worker)

      // Remove any request handlers added in individual test cases.
      // This prevents them from affecting unrelated tests.
      worker.resetHandlers()

      // Stop the worker after the test.
      worker.stop()
    },
    {
      auto: true,
    },
  ],
})
```

<Warning>
  Provide the `auto: true` fixture option so MSW would affect the tests that
  don't reference the `worker` fixture explicitly.
</Warning>

### Initial request handlers

Any `test()` now runs against the initial, happy-path request handlers (like those in `handlers.ts`) without explicitly referencing MSW. Leverage this for cleaner test suites and predictable baseline behavior.

```ts {1}
import { test } from './test-extend'
import { Dashboard } from './components/dashboard.js'

test('renders the dashboard', () => {
  // Uses only the happy-path request handlers.
  render(<Dashboard />)

  // Your actions and assertions...
})
```

### Overriding request handlers

You can [override request handlers](/docs/best-practices/network-behavior-overrides) by accessing the `worker` object of your test's context and calling `.use()`, providing it with the request handlers that should take priority:

```ts {2,10-14} /worker/1,3
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { test } from './test-extend'
import { Dashboard } from './components/dashboard.js'

test('displays a notification if fetching the dashboard failed', async ({
  worker,
}) => {
  // Prepend overrides to the happy-path handlers
  // on the `worker` object from the test's context.
  worker.use(
    http.post('/dashboard', () => {
      return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 500 })
    }),
  )

  render(<Dashboard />)

  // Your actions and assertions...
})
```
