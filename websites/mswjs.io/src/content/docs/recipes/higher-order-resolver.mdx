title: Higher-order resolver
---

Creating a higher-order resolver is a good way of managing the dynamic, and often repetitive, nature of the mocked responses. Since [Response resolver](/docs/http/intercepting-requests/#response-resolver) is a regular function, you can _return_ it from a higher-order function that can customize the resolver's behavior.

For example, this is how you can describe protected routes:

```js
// mocks/middleware.js
import { HttpResponse } from 'msw'

// A higher-order response resolver that validates
// the request authorization header before proceeding
// with the actual response resolver.
export function withAuth(resolver) {
  return (input) => {
    const { request } = input

    if (!request.headers.get('Authorization')) {
      return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 401 })
    }

    return resolver(input)
  }
}
```

```js {3,10} /withAuth/1,3
// mocks/handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { withAuth } from './middleware'

export const handlers = [
  // Using the "withAuth" higher-order response resolver
  // will require the outgoing requests to "POST /comment"
  // to have the "Authorization" header set before it returns
  // a mocked JSON response.
  http.post('/comment', withAuth(({ request }) => {
    const { author, text } = await request.json()
    return HttpResponse.json({ author, text }, { status: 201 })
  }))
]
```
