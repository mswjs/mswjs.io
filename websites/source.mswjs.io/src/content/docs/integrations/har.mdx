## Import

Import the `fromTraffic()` function from `@msw/source/traffic`:

```js
import { fromTraffic } from '@msw/source/traffic'
```

## Network archive

Next, you would need a network archive (`*.har`) file. You can use any existing HAR file you have, or learn how to record a new one:

import { BeakerIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
import { PageCard } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/pageCard'

<PageCard
  icon={BeakerIcon}
  title="Recording HAR"
  description="Learn how to record HAR files in the browser."
  url="/docs/recipes/recording-har"
/>

## Generate request handlers

Import the HAR file and provided it as an argument to the `fromTraffic()` function:

```js /fromTraffic/
import { fromTraffic } from '@msw/source/traffic'
import traffic from './api.har'

const handlers = fromTraffic(traffic)
```

> `*.har` files are JSON files, so you can import them directly in your code. In case you cannot, make sure to parse the archive file before passing it to `fromTraffic`.

## Features

### Response timing

Generated request handlers respect the response timing recorded in the respective HAR entries.

For example, the following network entry took 554ms to complete:

```json {5}
{
  "log": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "time": 554,
        "request": { ... },
        "response": { ... }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The request handler for this entry will delay the mocked response by 554ms to replay this HTTP request faithfully.

### Response order sensitivity

There may be multiple request/response entries for the same request in the archive. If that happens, Source will _exhaust_ the recorded responses in the same order they have been received.

In the example below, the same `GET https://example.com/cart` request receives two distinct responses:

```json {9-14,21-26}
{
  "log": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "request": {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "https://example.com/cart"
        },
        "response": {
          "status": 200,
          "content": {
            "text": "{\"items\":[]}"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "request": {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "https://example.com/cart"
        },
        "response": {
          "status": 200,
          "content": {
            "text": "{\"items\":[{\"id\":\"abc-123\"}]}"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The generated request handler for the `GET https://example.com/cart` endpoint will replay this network communication respectively:

```js {5,8}
const handlers = fromTraffic(traffic)
setupServer(...handlers).listen()

await fetch('https://example.com/cart').then((res) => res.json())
// {"items":[]}

await fetch('https://example.com/cart').then((res) => res.json())
// {"items":[{"id":"abc-123"}]}
```

Once the responses have been exhausted, the last recorded response will be used to respond to the matching request from there on out.

### Mapping network entries

You can transform network entries by providing a map function as the second argument to `fromTraffic`. The map function is called for every entry (`har.log.entries[n]`) in the archive, and acts similarly to `Array.prototype.map`.

```js {8}
const { BASE_URL } = process.env

fromTraffic(har, (entry) => {
  const url = new URL(entry.request.url)

  if (url.hostname === 'example.com') {
    url.hostname = BASE_URL
    entry.request.url = url.href
  }

  return entry
})
```

In this example, we are locating requests to `example.com` and rewriting their hostname to point to the `BASE_URL` we use in tests. This is handy if the recorded traffic was on production while we want to run tests against staging or local.

Using the map function also allows you to repurpose a single network archive by transforming its entries based on the test cases or debugging scenarios.

### Filtering network entries

If the map function returns `undefined`, the respective network entry is _completely skipped_. In that regard, the map function acts as a filter function.

```js {4-8}
fromTraffic(har, (entry) => {
  const url = new URL(entry.request.url)

  // Skip all requests that weren't made
  // to the "example.com" hostname.
  if (url.hostname !== 'example.com') {
    return
  }

  return entry
})
```
