Source is a library for generating request handlers for [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

## Motivation

[Request handlers](https://mswjs.io/docs/concepts/request-handler) is a great format to describe your network when working with MSW. In some cases, however, writing handlers by hand can lead to a suboptimal experience, specifically:

- When migrating large test suites to MSW;
- When writing regression tests for network scenarios reproduced elsewhere.

Source is designed to breach that gap and allow you to generate request handlers from supported inputs, like OpenAPI documents or HAR files.

I was inspired to create Source by a particular development workflow. Imagine you have finally reproduced a network-related issue in your browser, and now your job is to write a regression test for it. Refresh the page—and the reproduction is gone. So, instead, you should be able to save the network inro an `*.har` file, put it next to your test suite, and use Source to generate request handlers out of it and achieve reliable, reproducible network behavior to replay the issue on demand.

That is precisely what Source enables you to do!
