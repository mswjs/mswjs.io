## Import

MSW provides a designated [`http`](/docs/api/http) namespace for describing HTTP requests. We will use that namespace to describe what requests to intercept and how to respond to them.

import { Action } from '../../../components/react/action'

<Action>Import the `http` namespace from the `msw` package:</Action>

```js {2}
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = []
```

> Although GraphQL is often implemented over HTTP, we highly recommend using the designated `graphql` namespace for [describing GraphQL APIs](/docs/network-behavior/graphql).

## Request handler

Next, we will create a [Request handler](/docs/concepts/request-handler). Every method in the `http` namespace allows us to create a request handler corresponding to an HTTP request method:

```bash
http[method](predicate, resolver)
```

> Request handlers are functions that allow you to [Intercept requests](/docs/basics/intercepting-requests) and [Mock responses](/docs/basics/mocking-responses).

In this tutorial, we will describe a basic RESTful API that has the following endpoints:

- `GET /posts`, to return all existing posts;
- `POST /posts`, to create a new post;
- `DELETE /posts/:id`, to delete a post by ID.

Let's start by creating a request handler for the `GET /posts` requests.

<Action>Call `http.get()` to declare your first request handler</Action>

```js {9-14}
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  // By calling "http.get()" we're instructing MSW
  // to capture all outgoing "GET /posts" requests
  // and execute the given response resolver when they
  // happen.
  http.get('/posts', () => {
    // Response resolver allows you to react to captured requests,
    // respond with mock responses or passthrough requests entirely.
    // For now, let's just print a message to the console.
    console.log('Captured a "GET /posts" request')
  }),
]
```

import { Info } from '../../../components/react/info'

<Info>
  Note that you can also provide an absolute request URL to intercept requests
  to external services, like `http.get('https://example.com/resource')`.
</Info>

Following the same principle, add request handlers for the remaining endpoints:

```js {8-13}
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/posts', () => {
    console.log('Captured a "GET /posts" request')
  }),
  http.post('/posts', () => {
    console.log('Captured a "POST /posts" request')
  }),
  http.delete('/posts/:id', ({ params }) => {
    console.log(`Captured a "DELETE /posts/${params.id}" request`)
  }),
]
```

With these handlers defined, MSW will intercept the respective requests but won't do anything to respond to them just yet.

## Response resolver

Response resolver is the second argument to the request handler that decides how to handle the intercepted request. There are multiple things you can do with such a request: respond with a mock response, perform it as-is, perform a proxy request and augment the original response, etc. You can always learn more about response resolver on this pages:

import { PageCard } from '../../../components/react/pageCard'
import { LightBulbIcon, CubeTransparentIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-x-5">
  <PageCard
    icon={LightBulbIcon}
    url="/docs/concepts/response-resolver"
    title="Response resolver"

  <PageCard
    icon={CubeTransparentIcon}
    url="/docs/basics/mocking-responses"
    title="Mocking responses"
    description="Learn how to mock HTTP responses."
  />
</div>

In this tutorial, we will be responding to the intercepted requests with mock responses.

### Mocking responses

To respond to an intercepted request, construct a valid Fetch API `Response` instance and return it from the corresponding request handler. Although you can work with the `Response` instance directly, we highly recommend using the `HttpResponse` class provided by the library.

<Action>Import the `HttpResponse` class from `msw`:</Action>

```js /HttpResponse/
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
```

> Learn about what `HttpResponse` is and why you should use it over the standard `Response` in [here](/docs/api/http-response).

Next, let's construct the mocked response to return the list of all posts.

<Action>Return a mocked `HttpResponse` from the `GET /posts` resolver:</Action>

```js /HttpResponse/ {12}
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

// Let's keep a map of all existing posts in memory.
// At the beginning, this list is empty as we have no posts.
const allPosts = new Map()

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/posts', () => {
    // Construct a JSON response with the list of all posts
    // as the response body.
    return HttpResponse.json(Array.from(allPosts.values()))
  }),

  // ...the other request handlers.
]
```

Using the `HttpResponse.json()` static method, we are returning an `application/json` response from this resolver to be used as the mocked response.

### Reading request body

In the `POST /posts` handler, let's read the request body and push the new post to the `allPosts` map. We can get the reference to the intercepted request instance as the `request` argument to the response resolver function.

<Action>Read the request body using the `request` argument:</Action>

```js /request/1,3 {9}
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

const allPosts = new Map()

export const handlers = [
  http.post('/posts', async ({ request }) => {
    // Read the intercepted request body as JSON.
    const newPost = await request.json()

    // Push the new post to the map of all posts.
    allPosts.set(newPost.id, newPost)

    // Don't forget to declare a semantic "201 Created"
    // response and send back the newly created post!
    return HttpResponse.json(newPost, { status: 201 })
  }),
]
```

### Reading path parameters

Lastly, let's imlpement the `DELETE /posts/:id` resolver that will lookup and delete a post from `allPosts` by its ID. The path parameters of the request URL are parsed and stored as the `params` argument to the response resolver function.

<Action>Read the `id` path parameter using the `params` argument</Action>

```js /params/1,3
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

const allPosts = new Map()

export const handlers = [
  http.delete('/posts/:id', ({ params }) => {
    // All request path params are provided in the "params"
    // argument of the response resolver.
    const { id } = params

    // Let's attempt to grab the post by its ID.
    const deletedPost = allPosts.get(id)

    // Respond with a "404 Not Found" response if the given
    // post ID does not exist.
    if (!deletedPost) {
      return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 404 })
    }

    // Delete the post from the "allPosts" map.
    allPosts.delete(id)

    // Respond with a "200 OK" response and the deleted post.
    return HttpResponse.json(deletedPost)
  }),
]
```

Response resolver provide you with much more useful data about the intercepted request, such as request cookies, GraphQL query and variables, and more. Learn more about the [Response resolvers](/docs/concepts/response-resolver) to unlock their full potential.

### Reading request cookies

Access the parsed value of the request's `Cookie` header as the `cookies` key on the response resolver object argument:

```js /cookies/ {2}
http.get('/user', ({ cookies }) => {
  const { session } = cookies

  if (!session) {
    return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 401 })
  }
})
```
