## Basics

Mock Service Worker respects the [WHATWG Fetch API specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), which means that the mocked responses you construct are the same responses you would receive when making a `fetch` call. If you are comfortable with the `Response` class, you can skip everything past this section—you know how to declare responses already.

To respond to an intercepted request, return a valid `Response` instance from the matching request handler:

```js {8}
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  // Intercept the "GET /resource" request.
  http.get('/resource', () => {
    // And respond with a "text/plain" response
    // with a "Hello world!" text response body.
    return new Response('Hello world!')
  }),
]
```

You don't need to import the `Response` class because it's a part of the global Fetch API in the browser and modern versions of Node.js (v17+). The library supports any variations of the `Response` instances, including shorthand responses created via methods like `Response.json()` or `Response.error()`.

### Using `HttpResponse` class

Although you can use plain Fetch API responses, it's highly recommended you use the custom `HttpResponse` class provided by the library. There are two reasons to prefer `HttpResponse` over the native `Response`:

1. The `HttpResponse` class encapsulates useful shorthand methods for declaring responses, like `HttpResponse.json()`, `HttpResponse.xml()`, `HttpResponse.formData()`, etc.
1. Unlike the native `Response` class, the `HttpResponse` class enables support for mocking response cookies by setting the `Set-Cookie` header on the mocked response.

Here's the same `GET /resource` handler but using the `HttpResponse` class:

```js {7}
// 1. Import the "HttpResponse" class from the library.
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/resource', () => {
    // 2. Return a mocked "Response" instance from the handler.
    return HttpResponse.text('Hello world!')
  }),
]
```

> `HttpResponse` is 100% compatible with the native `Response` class. Under the hood, `HttpResponse` returns a plain Fetch API `Response` instance.

## Mocking status code and text

Provide the `status` and/or `statusText` property in the response initializer object to specify a mocked response status or response status code, respectively.

```js {6-7}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/apples', () => {
    return new HttpResponse(null, {
      status: 404,
      statusText: 'Out Of Apples',
    })
  }),
]
```

## Mocking headers

Provide the `headers` property in the response initializer object to specify mocked response headers.

```js {6-9}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.post('/auth', () => {
    return new HttpResponse(null, {
      headers: {
        'Set-Cookie': 'mySecret=abc-123',
        'X-Custom-Header': 'yes',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

## Mocking body

You can respond to requests with various response body types: `String`, `Blob`, `FormData`, `ReadableStream`, and others (see [Fetch API `Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) for supported response body types).

Below, let's take a look at how to mock some of the most common HTTP response bodies.

### Text responses

The most basic response in HTTP is a text response. Provide the text string you wish to respond with as an argument to the `HttpResponse` constructor to create a mocked text response:

```js {5}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handler = [
  http.get('/name', () => {
    return new HttpResponse('John')
  }),
]
```

> You can also use [`HttpResponse.text()`](/docs/api/http-response#httpresponsetextbody-init) shorthand static method.

### JSON responses

A much more common response body type is JSON. Provide the JSON you wish to respond with as an argument to the `HttpResponse.json()` static method to create a mocked JSON response:

```js /HttpResponse.json/ {7-10}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.post('/auth', () => {
    // Note that you DON'T have to stringify the JSON!
    return HttpResponse.json({
      user: {
        id: 'abc-123',
        name: 'John Maverick',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

> We recommend using the [`HttpResponse.json()`](/docs/api/http-response#httpresponsejsonbody-init) shorthand static method to automatically keep the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` response headers in-sync with the response JSON body you're using.

### Stream responses

You can respond with a `ReadableStream` to stream any data back to the client.

import { PageCard } from '../../../components/react/pageCard'

  url="/docs/recipes/streaming"
  title="Streaming"
  description="Respond with a `ReadableStream`."
/>

### Other responses

There are many other response body types you can describe with MSW, like XML, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, or `FormData`. Please refer to the `HttpResponse` API to learn more about using other response body types.

## Mocking error responses

Construct and return a valid error response from a response resolver to emulate an error response.

```js /status: 401/
http.get('/user', () => {
  // Respond with "401 Unauthorized" to "GET /user" requests.
  return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 401 })
})
```

## Mocking network errors

Use the `Response.error()` or `HttpResponse.error()` static method to raise a network error. Unlike an error response, a network error will halt the request execution and will mark that request as failed. In practice, you may experience network errors when constructing an invalid request or requesting hostnames that cannot be resolved.

```js {2}
http.post('/checkout/cart', () => {
  return HttpResponse.error()
})
```
