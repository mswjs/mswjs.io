## Call signature

The `worker.resetHandlers()` method can be called without any arguments. When done so, all the [Runtime request handlers](/docs/concepts/request-handler#runtime-request-handler) (those prepended via `worker.use()`) will be removed.

```js {4}
const worker = setupWorker(http.get('/resource', resolevr))
worker.use(http.post('/user', resolver))

worker.resetHandlers()
// The "POST /user" runtime request handler is removed,
// and only the "GET /resource" initial request handler remains.
```

The `worker.resetHandlers()` method also accepts an optional list of request handlers spread as its arguments. When such a list is provided, the initial request handlers passed to `setupWorker()` will also be removed, and the given list of request handlers would act as the initial handlers.

```js
const worker = setupWorker(http.get('/resource', resolver))
worker.use(http.post('/user', resolver))

worker.resetHandlers(http.patch('/book/:bookId', resolver))
// Both the runtime "POST /user" and the initial "GET /resource"
// request handlers are removed, and only the "PATCH /book/:bookId"
// request handler remains.
```
