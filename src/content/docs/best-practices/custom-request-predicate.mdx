title: Custom request predicate
---

By default, MSW gives you the means to intercept requests based on their method and path (for HTTP requests) or their operation kind and name (for GraphQL requests). You can, however, create a custom matching logic to intercept requests based on other criteria, for example:

- Intercept a request that has a `foo` _query parameter_;
- Intercept a request that has a JSON _request body_ with a `bar` property.

Let's implement both of these custom request predicates.

## Query parameter predicate

You can implement a custom request predicate using a [higher-order resolver](/docs/recipes/higher-order-resolver) function. In the example below, we will create a `withSearchParams` function that will help us match requests that satisfy a custom `predicate` based on the request's query parameters.

```js
// withSearchParams.js
import { passthrough } from 'msw'

export function withSearchParams(predicate, resolver) {
  return (args) => {
    const { request } = args
    const url = new URL(request.url)

    if (!predicate(url.searchParams)) {
      return passthrough()
    }

    return resolver(args)
  }
}
```

> The `resolver` argument is the actual response resolver we will specify upon usage. The logic around it determines when to call it, allowing for conditional response resolution.

We can then use the `withSearchParams` function instead of the response resolver anywhere we wish:

```js
// handlers.js
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { withSearchParams } from './withSearchParams'

export const handlers = [
  http.get(
    '/user',
    withSearchParams(
      // Only match "GET /user" requests that have
      // the "userId" query parameter present.
      (params) => params.has('userId'),
      ({ request, params, cookies }) => {
        return HttpResponse.json({
          name: 'John Maverick',
        })
      }
    )
  ),
]
```

## Request body predicate

Implementing a custom request body predicate is no different from the query predicate. We will create a `withJsonBody` function that will provide the matching logic and call the `resolver` conditionally.

```js
// withJsonBody.js
import isEqual from 'lodash.isequal'

export function withJsonBody(expectedBody, resolver) {
  return async (args) => {
    const { request } = args

    // Ignore requests that have a non-JSON body.
    const contentType = request.headers.get('Content-Type') || ''
    if (!contentType.includes('application/json')) {
      return
    }

    // Clone the request and read it as JSON.
    const actualBody = await request.clone().json()

    // Compare two objects using "lodash".
    if (!isEqual(actualBody, expectedBody)) {
      return
    }

    return resolver(args)
  }
}
```

import { Warning } from '../../../components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Make sure to *clone the request* before reading its body. If you don't, you
  won't be able to read it in the `resolver`.
</Warning>

```js
http.post(
  '/user',
  // Only match "POST /user" requests that have the
  // "id" property of their body equal to "abc-123".
  withJsonBody(
    {
      id: 'abc-123',
    },
    ({ request, params, cookies }) => {
      return HttpResponse.json({}, { status: 201 })
    }
  )
)
```

## Advanced

For more advanced scenarios, consider implementing a custom request handler. You can do that by extending the `RequestHandler` class exported from the library.

import { CubeTransparentIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
import { PageCard } from '../../../components/react/pageCard'

<PageCard
  icon={CubeTransparentIcon}
  url="/docs/api/request-handler"
  title="RequestHandler"
  description="API reference for the `RequestHandler` class."
/>
