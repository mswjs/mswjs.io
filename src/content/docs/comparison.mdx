Choosing the right tool for the job is crucial. We tried our best to provide a comprehensive and unbiased comparison between Mock Service Worker and other open-source API mocking libraries below.

import { Warning } from '../../components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  The purpose of this page is not to reason about what technology is better or
  worse. All the libraries listed here have a place to be, and grading them is
  not only subjective, but also disrespectful towards the people who really
  should be using one over another.
</Warning>

## Comparison criteria

Any good comparison begins with a clearly defined set of criteria. Here are the criteria we used when comparing MSW to alternatives (written from a developer's perspective):

- **Supported API types**. What kinds of API can I mock with the library?
- **Environment**. In which environments can I use the library?
- **Implementation**. How does the library implement request interception?
- **Integration**. How much effort it takes to integrate it into my project?
- **Definition**. How do I define mocks?

## Nock

[Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) is an HTTP server mocking and expectations library for Node.js.

> Nock is a great library for combining API mocking and assertions in Node.js. While Mock Service Worker doesn't come with a built-in assertion capabilities, it allows you to seamlessly reuse the same mocks across browser and Node.js, as well as providing first-class GraphQL support and standard-based request/response handling.

### API support

| API type      | Nock | Mock Service Worker |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| REST API      | ✅   | ✅                  |
| GraphQL API   | ❌   | ✅                  |
| WebSocket API | ❌   | ❌                  |

### Supported environment

| Environment | Nock | Mock Service Worker |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| Node.js     | ✅   | ✅                  |
| Browser     | ❌   | ✅                  |

### Integration

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does not require any changes to the code.                                         | Does not require any changes to the code.                       |
| Requires additional adapters to intercept specific request clients (e.g. `axios`) | Works with any request client without additional configuration. |

### Definition

#### Nock

Nock uses _method chaining_ to intercept requests and declare mocked responses:

```js
nock('https://api.example.com').get('/user').reply(200, { id: 1, name: 'John' })
```

#### Mock Service Worker

MSW models its interception API after server-side routing and handles requests and responses according to the Fetch API specification, using the same classes you would use normally in JavaScript:

```js
http.get('https://api.example.com/user', async ({ request }) => {
  const payload = await request.json()
  return HttpResponse.json({ id: 1, name: 'John' })
})
```

## JSON Server

[JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) allows you to create an actual HTTP server based on a JSON file.

> JSON Server is an actual HTTP server that utilizes abstract response definition format. This means a server you have to run and maintain. Mock Service Worker doesn't spawn any servers, so its initialization cost is free. Mock Service Worker also allows you to have a more error-proof mock definitions by using languages like TypeScript and generating mocks out of the actual backend implementation.

### API support

| API type      | JSON Server | Mock Service Worker |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| REST API      | ✅          | ✅                  |
| GraphQL API   | ❌          | ✅                  |
| WebSocket API | ❌          | ❌                  |

### Supported environment

| Environment | JSON Server    | Mock Service Worker |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Node.js     | ✅             | ✅                  |
| Browser     | ✅<sup>1</sup> | ✅                  |

> <sup>1</sup>—JSON Server doesn't actually run in the browser. Since it's a
> standalone server, it can be requested from anywhere in your system.

### Integration

| Works with any request client without additional configuration.          | Works with any request client without additional configuration. |

### Definition

#### JSON Server

JSON Server uses a resource-first routes format that implicitly generates request paths and describes mocked responses.

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "mock-service-worker" }
  ]
}
```

> This will automatically generated server-side routes like `GET /posts` and `DELETE /posts/:index` based on the described resources. The nature of such routes is static and requires additional abstractions to achieve more complex network behaviors.

#### Mock Service Worker

MSW models its interception API after server-side routing and handles requests and responses according to the Fetch API specification, using the same classes you would use normally in JavaScript:

```js
http.get('/posts', () => {
  return HttpResponse.json([
    { id: 1, title: 'json-server' },
    { id: 2, title: 'mock-service-worker' },
  ])
})
```

> With MSW, you have to explicitly define server-side operations like `http.get('/posts')` or `http.delete('/posts/:index')`. MSW prioritized explicitness, taking advantage of programmatic request resolution, allowing for more complex network behaviors.

## Mirage

[Mirage](https://github.com/miragejs/miragejs) is an API mocking library that lets you build, test and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to rely on any backend services.

> Mirage is centered around data modeling to emulate more complex server behaviors. Mock Service Worker doesn't come with a built-in data modeling capabilities and instead exposes them in a separate package called [`@mswjs/data`](https://github.com/mswjs/data). This way you can bring modeling to the table once you need it.

### Definition

#### Mirage

Mirage uses route handlers format to define server-like routes and mocked responses.

```js
createServer({
  routes() {
    this.get('/movies', () => {
      return ['Interstellar', 'Inception', 'Dunkirk']
    })
  },
})
```

Mirage also comes with an in-memory database to help you model more complex data relationships.

```js
createServer({
  models: {
    movie: Model.extend({
      castMembers: hasMany(),
    }),
    castMember: Model.extend({
      movie: belongsTo(),
    }),
  },
  routes() {
    // Your route handlers responding with the data.
  },
})
```

#### Mock Service Worker

MSW models its interception API after server-side routing and handles requests and responses according to the Fetch API specification, using the same classes you would use normally in JavaScript:

```js
http.get('/movies', () => {
  return HttpResponse.json(['Interstellar', 'Inception', 'Dunkirk'])
})
```

Although MSW doesn't ship data modeling capabilities built-in, it leverages ecosystem packages, like [`@mswjs/data`](https://github.com/mswjs/data), to give you a data-first approach to API mocking if you choose it.

```js
import { factory, primaryKey, oneOf, manyOf } from '@mswjs/data'

// Model the data.
const db = factory({
  movie: {
    id: primaryKey(randomUuid),
    title: String,
    castMembers: manyOf('castMember'),
  },
  castMember: {
    id: primaryKey(randomUuid),
    name: String,
    movie: oneOf('movie'),
  },
})

// Generate request handlers based on the models.
// - GET /movies
// - GET /movies/:id
// - POST /movies
// - ...
db.toHandlers('rest')

// Including GraphQL queries!
// - query ListMovies
// - query GetMovie
// - mutation AddMovie
// - ...
db.toHandlers('graphql')
```

## Cypress - `cy.intercept()`

[Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) is an end-to-end testing framework that provides API mocking capabilities through its `cy.intercept()` API.

### API support

| API type      | `cy.intercept()` | Mock Service Worker |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| REST API      | ✅               | ✅                  |
| GraphQL API   | ❌<sup>1</sup>   | ✅                  |
| WebSocket API | ❌               | ❌                  |

> <sup>1</sup>—Although it is possible to work with GraphQL requests through
> custom aliasing, it still requires a lot of additional setup. Cypress achieves
> GraphQL API mocking through HTTP handling (since GraphQL is most commonly
> implemented over HTTP on the web) instead of a first-class GraphQL support.

### Supported environments

| API type | `cy.intercept()` | Mock Service Worker |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Node.js  | ❌<sup>1</sup>   | ✅                  |

### Definition

#### `cy.intercept()`

Cypress uses a custom matcher signature and a route handler function to intercept and handle requests. It utilizes custom methods like `req.reply()`, `req.continue()` or `req.redirect()` for more detailed request control.

```js
cy.intercept('POST', '/users', {
  statusCode: 201,
  body: req.body,
  delay: 100,
})
```

#### Mock Service Worker

MSW models its interception API after server-side routing and handles requests and responses according to the Fetch API specification, using the same classes you would use normally in JavaScript:

```js
import { http, delay } from 'msw'

http.post('/users', async ({ request }) => {
  // Read the request body as you would normally.
  const user = await request.json()

  // Control the response resolver execution flow
  // via Promises, like this "delay" Promise below.
  await delay(100)

  // Construct a response as you would normally.
  return HttpResponse.json(user, { status: 201 })
})
```

MSW gives you a more advanced control over the requests through its `passthrough()` and `bypass()` APIs, which still yield semantic HTTP responses under the hood.

## Playwright - `page.route()`

[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is a browser testing tool that provides API mocking capabilities through its `page.route()` API.

### API support

| API type      | `page.route()` | Mock Service Worker |

| WebSocket API | ❌             | ❌                  |

> <sup>1</sup>—You can handle GraphQL requests with `page.route()` since they
> are also HTTP requests but Playwright does not provide a first-class support
> for mocking GraphQL APIs.

### Supported environments

| -------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Node.js  | ❌<sup>1</sup> | ✅                  |
| Browser  | ✅             | ✅                  |

> <sup>1</sup>—Although with Playwright you write your tests in Node.js,
> Playwright itself (and its `page.route()`) only affect the traffic in the
> spawned browser, not the Node.js process.

### Implementation

| Environment | `page.route()` | Mock Service Worker                                                  |

### Definition

#### `page.route()`

The `page.route()` function in Playwright utilizes custom methods like `route.fulfill()` and `route.continue()` to give you more control over the request.

```js
page.route('/fruits', async (route) => {
  const request = route.request()

  if (request.method === 'POST') {
    const response = await route.fetch()
    const json = await response.json()
    json.push({ name: 'Playwright' })

    return route.fulfill({ response, json })
  }

  route.continue()
})
```

#### Mock Service Worker

```js
import { bypass } from 'msw'

http.post('/fruits', async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await fetch(bypass(request))
  const json = await response.json()
  json.push({ name: 'Mock Service Worker' })

  return HttpResponse.json(json, response)
})
```

> The alternative for `route.continue()` in MSW is simply returning nothing from a response resolver. But since we can narrow down the request interception to both the method (`POST`) and path (`/fruits`), our request handler never concerns itself with other requests.

MSW uses the custom [`bypass()`](/docs/api/bypass) function that wraps any given `Request` instance to prevent it from being affected by any other otherwise matching request handlers.
