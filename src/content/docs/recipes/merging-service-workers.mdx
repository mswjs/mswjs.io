The browser can only register a single Service Worker per scope. This means that if your application already registers a Service Worker, it cannot register another one for MSW in parallel. You can still use both your custom Service Worker and MSW by _merging the two worker scripts_.

<Action>Import MSW's worker in your existing worker</Action>

First, modify your existing worker script to conditionally import `/mockServiceWorker.js`. Use the [`importScripts()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts) available globally in the worker's scope.

```js {4-6}
// public/existing-worker.js
const url = new URL(location.href)

if (url.searchParams.get('enableApiMocking') === 'true') {
  importScripts('/mockServiceWorker.js')
}

// The rest of your Service Worker script here.
// self.addEventListener('fetch', listener)
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to complete the [Browser integration](/docs/integrations/browser) to
  have the `mockServiceWorker.js` script generated in your public directory and
  thus available from the root of your application.
</Warning>

<Action>Enable API mocking conditionally</Action>

```js {4-9}
// src/app.js
const workerUrl = new URL('/existing-worker.js', location.origin)

// In your application code, set the "enableApiMocking" search parameter
// on the worker script URL. This way the client lets the worker know
// whether it should import MSW's worker script based on the environment.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  workerUrl.searchParams.set('enableApiMocking', 'true')
}

navigator.serviceWorker.register(workerUrl.href)
```

<Action>Set up MSW to use your worker</Action>

Lastly, provide your worker script URL as the `serviceWorker.url` option on the `worker.start()` call. Since the only Service Worker you register is your custom worker, let MSW know that it should use it to control the network.

```js {3}
worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    url: '/existing-worker.js',
  },
})
```
