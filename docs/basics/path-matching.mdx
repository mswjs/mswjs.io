To determine which outgoing requests should be mocked, Mock Service Worker performs request path matching. It's a process when an actual request is compared to the predicate of your request handlers from `setupWorker()` call.

> Path matching is relevant only for REST API. When working with GraphQL, requests are matched by the _operation name_. Learn more about how Mock Service Worker matches GraphQL requests in the [GraphQL API section](/docs/api/graphql).

By default, any outgoing request is matched using these criteria:

- Has matching method;
- Has matching URL.~

<Hint>
  Request that doesn't have any corresponding request handlers is performed
  as-is.
</Hint>

## URL matching

There are three ways to match a request:

- Using exact URL string;
- Using a path;
- Using a RegExp.

<Hint mode="warning">
  URL query parameters and hashes <strong>are ignored</strong> when matching
  request URL.
</Hint>

## Exact URL

When providing an exact URL string, only requests that match that string would be mocked. Mock Service Worker uses _strict_ strings comparison, but ignores trailing slashes.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=5
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

setupWorker(
  // Only "POST https://api.backend.dev/users" requests would match this handler
  rest.post('https://api.backend.com/users', responseResolver),
)
```

## Path

Mock Service Worker uses an Express-like path syntax to match requests.

Path is an abstraction over regular expression for shorthand wildcard and path parameters definition. See the examples of using paths below.

### Path with wildcard

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=7
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

setupWorker(
  // Matches:
  // - /users/admin
  // - /users/octocat
  rest.get('/users/*', responseResolver),
)
```

### Path with parameters

To add a parameter to your request path use the `:paramName` format.

```js  showLineNumbers focusedLines=5
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

setupWorker(
  // Given "POST https://api.backend.dev/user/abc-123" request,
  rest.post('https://api.backend.dev/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    // `userId` value becomes "abc-123"
    const { userId } = req.params
  }),
)
```

### REPL

Try out how Mock Service Worker matches paths in the interactive form below.

<PathMatchPreview path="/user/:userId" url="/user/0251e7ac" />

## RegExp

When provided a regular expression, request URL must match that expression in order to be mocked. Unlike URL string matching, regular expressions use _weak_ comparison, supportng partial matches.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=8
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

setupWorker(
  // This request handler would match all these requests:
  // - DELETE http://localhost:8080/posts/
  // - DELETE https://backend.dev/user/posts/
  rest.delete(/\/posts\//, responseResolver),
)
```
