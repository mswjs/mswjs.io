title: Life-cycle events
order: 61
---

The life-cycle events API allows you to attach listeners to the internal library events, such as when a new request is made or a mocked response is sent. This API is primarily designed for third-party extensions or for debugging request handlers.

> Life-cycle events happen post-factum and **cannot affect** related requests/responses.

<Hint>
  This API is <strong>not meant for mocking</strong>. Use{' '}
  <a href="/docs/api/setup-worker">
    <code>setupWorker</code>
  </a>
  /<a href="/docs/api/setup-server">
    <code>setupServer</code>
  </a> instead.
</Hint>

## Usage

The life-cycle events API is exposed under the `.events` property of the `worker`/`server` instance:

```js
const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
worker.events

// or

const server = setupServer(...handlers)
server.events
```

The API itself resembles the [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/events.html) but is stripped down to the following methods:

- `on`, to react to a given event;
- `removeListener`, to remove a listener for a given event;
- `removeAllListeners`, to remove all listeners.

> Such limitation is intended, as you mustn't emit internal events—that is done for you by the library.

## Methods

### `on`

Use the `.on` method to add an event listener to a given life-cycle event.

```js
worker.events.on('request:start', (req) => {
  console.log(req.method, req.url.href)
})
```

### `removeListener`

Removes the listener for the given life-cycle event.

Removing listeners is particularly handy to reset the events introspection during tests.

```js
// Previously attached listener.
const listener = () => console.log('new request')
worker.events.on('request:start', listener)

worker.events.removeListener('request:start', listener)
```

### `removeAllListeners`

Removes all life-cycle events listeners.

```js
worker.events.removeAllListeners()
```

Optionally, accepts a life-cycle event name to specify which group of listeners to remove, in case there are multiple.

```js
// Removes all listeners for the "request:start" event,
// but keeps all the other listeners.
worker.events.removeAllListeners('request:start')
```

## Events

### `request:start`

A new request has been dispatched.

| Parameter name | Type            | Description               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `req`          | `MockedRequest` | A request representation. |

```js
worker.events.on('request:start', (req) => {
  console.log('new request:', req.method, req.url.href)
})
```

### `request:match`

A dispatched request has a corresponding request handler.

| Parameter name | Type            | Description               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `req`          | `MockedRequest` | A request representation. |

```js
worker.events.on('request:match', (req) => {
  console.log('%s %s has a handler!', req.method, req.url.href)
})
```

### `request:unhandled`

A dispatched request doesn't have any corresponding request handler.

| Parameter name | Type            | Description               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `req`          | `MockedRequest` | A request representation. |

```js
worker.events.on('request:unhandled', (req) => {
  console.log('%s %s has no handler', req.method, req.url.href)
})
```

### `request:end`

A request has ended. Emits for all requests regardless if their responses were mocked or bypassed.

| Parameter name | Type            | Description               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `req`          | `MockedRequest` | A request representation. |

```js
worker.events.on('request:end', (req) => {
  console.log('%s %s ended', req.method, req.url.href)
})
```

### `response:mocked`

A mocked response has been sent.

| Parameter name | Type                                               | Description                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `res`          | `Response` (worker), `IsomorphicResponse` (server) | The response that's been sent.  |
| `reqId`        | `string`                                           | UUID of the associated request. |

```js
worker.events.on('response:mocked', async (res, reqId) => {
  const responseText = await res.text()
  console.log('sent a mocked response', reqId, responseText)
})
```

<Hint>
  Note that the <code>res</code> instance differs between the browser and
  Node.js. Take this difference into account when operating with it.
</Hint>

```js
server.events.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {
  const responseText = res.body
  console.log('sent a mocked response', reqId, responseText)
})
```

### `response:bypass`

An original response has been sent.

| Parameter name | Type                                               | Description                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `res`          | `Response` (worker), `IsomorphicResponse` (server) | The response that's been sent.  |
| `reqId`        | `string`                                           | UUID of the associated request. |

```js
worker.events.on('response:bypass', async (res, reqId) => {
  const responseText = await res.text()
  console.log('sent an original response', reqId, responseText)
})
```

Just as with the `response:mocked` event, the `res` instance is different between the browser and Node.js.

```js
server.events.on('response:bypass', (res, reqId) => {
  const responseText = res.body
  console.log('sent an original response', reqId, responseText)
})
```

## Examples

### Tracking a request

Although each life-cycle events emits in isolation, it includes a request ID (`reqId`) parameter to connect related requests and responses.

```js focusedLines=5-6,10-11
const allRequests = new Map()

worker.events.on('request:start', (req) => {
  const { id } = req
  // Store this request by id in an internal Map.
  allRequests.set(id, req)
})

worker.events.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {
  // Get a request associated with this response.
  const req = allRequests.get(reqId)
})
```

### Asserting request payload

The life-cycle events API can be used for retrieving a request reference and writing request assertions (i.e. whether the correct request payload was sent).

<Hint mode="warning">
  Request assertions should <strong>be avoided</strong> whenever possible.
  Always prefer testing the logic/UI dependent on the response to ensure
  request/response validity. Read more about{' '}
  <a href="/docs/recipes/request-assertions">Request assertions</a>.
</Hint>

```js
import { matchRequestUrl, MockedRequest } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

const server = setupServer(...handlers)

function waitForRequest(method: string, url: string) {
  let requestId = ''

  return new Promise<MockedRequest>((resolve, reject) => {
    server.events.on('request:start', (req) => {
      const matchesMethod = req.method.toLowerCase() === method.toLowerCase()
      const matchesUrl = matchRequestUrl(req.url, url).matches

      if (matchesMethod && matchesUrl) {
        requestId = req.id
      }
    })

    server.events.on('request:match', (req) => {
      if (req.id === requestId) {
        resolve(req)
      }
    })

    server.events.on('request:unhandled', (req) => {
      if (req.id === requestId) {
        reject(
          new Error(`The ${req.method} ${req.url.href} request was unhandled.`),
        )
      }
    })
  })
}

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())

it('sends the user credentials to the backend', async () => {
  // Establish a request listener but don't resolve it yet.
  const pendingRequest = waitForRequest('POST', '/login')

  // Perform the request itself.
  // Here you would use any tested code that makes a request.
  await fetch('/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: 'user@example.com',
      password: 'super+secret123',
    }),
  })

  // Await the request and get its reference.
  const request = await pendingRequest

  expect(request.body).toEqual({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    password: 'super+secret123',
  })
})
```
