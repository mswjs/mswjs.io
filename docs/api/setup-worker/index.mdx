title: setupWorker()

---

A function that configures a Service Worker instance with a given mock definition, and returns the API to control that worker instance.

## Examples

The `setupWorker()` function is used for client-side mocking. You usually create a worker instance and activate it by calling the `start()` method on the returned API.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3,16
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(
  // Provide request handlers
  rest.get('/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Maverick',
      }),
    )
  }),
)

// Start the Mock Service Worker
worker.start()
```
