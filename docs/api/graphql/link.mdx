title: link()
order: 544
---

A high-order request handler that scopes a [GraphQL API](/docs/api/graphql/) under the given endpoint.

`graphql.link()` is primarily designed for applications that communicate with multiple GraphQL endpoints to prevent operation name collision during API mocking.

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  link(uri: string): GraphQLRequestHandlers
}
```

## Examples

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3-4,7-8
import { setupWorker, graphql } from 'msw'

const github = graphql.link('https://api.github.com/v4')
const stripe = graphql.link('https://api.stripe.com/graphql')

const worker = setupWorker(
  github.query('GetUser', resolveGitHubUser),
  stripe.mutation('Payment', resolveStripePayment),

  // Although this operation name is `GetUser`,
  // it will get captured only when the request is issued
  // against the current location (no link specified).
  graphql.query('GetUser', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res()
  }),
)

worker.start()
```
