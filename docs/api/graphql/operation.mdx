A request handler that targets any GraphQL operation, regardless of type or name.

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  operation(resolver: ResponseResolver): RequestHandler
}
```

## Examples

### Fixed response

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from 'msw'

graphql.operation((req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.errors([
      {
        message: 'Access denied',
        positions: [1, 92],
      },
    ]),
  )
})
```

### Resolve against schema

You can resolve any operation against a predefined schema, opposed to a fixed response. Here's an example of using the `graphql` package to resolve an operation against a predefined `schema`:

```js focusedLines=16
import { graphql as graphqlRequest, buildSchema } from 'graphql'
import { graphql } from 'msw'

const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`)

const root = {
  hello: () => {
    return 'Hello world!'
  },
}

graphql.operation(async (req, res, ctx) => {
  const payload = await graphqlRequest(
    schema,
    req.body.query,
    root,
    null,
    req.variables,
  )

  return res(ctx.data(payload.data), ctx.errors(payload.errors))
})
```
