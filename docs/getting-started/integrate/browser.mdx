## Setup

Mock Service Worker operates client-side by registering a Service Worker responsible for requests interception. However, we don't have to write any of the worker's code by ourselves, but rather copy the worker file distributed by the library. Mock Service Worker provides a dedicated CLI to help us do that.

<Action>
  Execute the <code>init</code> command of the Mock Service Worker CLI:
</Action>

```bash
$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
```

Replace the `<PUBLIC_DIR>` placeholder with the relative path to your server's public directory. For example, in a Create React App project this command would be:

```bash
$ npx msw init public/
```

import PublicDirSnippet from '../../snippets/public-dir.mdx'

<PublicDirSnippet />

## Configure worker

Let's create a file in our mock definition directory (`src/mocks`) where we would configure and start our Service Worker.

<Action>
  Create a <code>src/mocks/browser.js</code> file:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks/browser.js
```

In the `browser.js` file we are going to create a worker instance with our request handlers defined earlier.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupWorker</code> function from the <code>msw</code> package and
  create a worker instance with previously defined request handlers
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7-8
// src/mocks/browser.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a Service Worker with the given request handlers.
export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
```

## Start worker

In order for our mock definition to excute during the runtime, it needs to be imported into our application's code. However, since mocking is a development-oriented technique, we will be importing our `src/mocks/browser.js` file _conditionally_, depending on the current environment.

<Hint mode="warning">
  It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to include Mock Service Worker in
  production. Doing so may lead to a distorted experience for your users.
</Hint>
<Action>
  Import the <code>browser.js</code> file conditionally following one of the
  examples below:
</Action>

### Using conditional import

Adding a conditional import is the optimal choice, as you don't always have access to the project's build configuration.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-9
// src/index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  const { worker } = require('./mocks/browser')
  worker.start()
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### Using webpack

If you can access your build configuration, consider importing the mock definition as a conditional entry module. This is the best strategy for your application to know nothing about the mocking.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-7
// webpack.config.js
const __DEV__ = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    // Conditionally include the mock definition file
    __DEV__ && 'src/mocks/browser.js',

    // Include your application's entry
    'src/index.js',
  ].filter(Boolean),
  // The rest of your webpack config...
}
```

## Verify & Inspect

After importing the mock definition, you should see a successful activation message from Mock Service Worker in your browser's console:

<ConsoleMessage>[MSW] Mocking enabled</ConsoleMessage>

Any requests that match previously defined handlers will now be intercepted and mocked.
