title: Using local HTTPS
---

When using Mock Service Worker on a local HTTPS server, you'll encounter issues during the worker script registration in the browser:

```txt copyable=false
SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: An SSL certificate error occurred when fetching the script.
```

Such error is **expected** and is thrown by **the browser** whenever you attempt to register a Service Worker over insecure HTTPS. That limitation is implemented according to the Service Worker specification and serves to prevent security vulnerabilities when intercepting a network traffic on insecure connections.

## Solutions

Connections signed by invalid or self-signed certificates are automatically considered insecure. Below you can see a few suggestions on how to enable API mocking on a local HTTPS environment.

### (Recommended) Use a signed SSL certificate

Always favor signed SSL certificates, even when developing locally. Use services like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to sign your SSL certificate and enable Service Workers in your application.

### Trust the self-signed sertificate

This is a system-wide option. You can configure your OS to trust the self-signed certificate you're using for development. Please refer to the respective instructions depending on your OS.

### Trust insecure localhost

Alternatively, you can configure your browser to trust `https://localhost` despite it using an invalid certificate. Please resort to this option as a **last measure**, since adjusting the default browser security rules may lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if handled poorly.

#### Chrome

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
1. Locate the `allow-insecure-localhost` flag in the list.
1. Select the "Enabled" option from the flag's dropdown.

#### Firefox

1. Open your local HTTPS application.
1. On the "_Connection is not secture_" screen click the "_Advanced_" button.
1. In the section below, click the "_Add Exception_" button.
1. Specify your application's URL as the "_Location_" input value.
1. Click the "_Confirm Security Exception_" button to enable the exception.
