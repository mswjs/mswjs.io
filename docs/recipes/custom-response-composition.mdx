title: Custom response composition
---

Sometimes the default response serializer (`application/json`), provided by the default [response transformer](/docs/basics/response-transformer), isn't what you need and you're looking for a way to overwrite the default serialization for a response.

In this recipe we are going to write a custom response transformer that serializes `BigInt` values that cannot be otherwise transformed using `JSON.stringify`.

## Creating a composition

Use the `createResponseComposition` API to create a custom response composition.

```js
// src/mocks/res/delayed-response.js
import { createResponseComposition, context } from 'msw'

export const delayedResponse = createResponseComposition(null, [
  context.delay('real'),
])
```

The `createResponseComposition` accepts two arguments:

- Response overrides. An object of [response properties](/docs/api/response) to override on each mocked response.
- List of [response transformers](/docs/basics/response-transformer) to modify the mocked response.

In the example above we've created a custom `delayedResponse` composition that attaches a realistic delay time to every mocked response. We're using an existing `context.delay` function as opposed to `createResponseComposition({ delay: 123 })` because it comes with the behavior with need out of the box.

## Using a composition

Once the custom response transformer is defined, use it to return the response instead of using the default response method.

```ts
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { rest } from 'msw'
import { delayedResponse } from './res/delayed-response'

export const handlers = [
  rest.get('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    // This mocked response has realistic
    // response time automatically.
    return delayedResponse(
      ctx.json({
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Maverick',
      }),
    )
  }),
]
```
