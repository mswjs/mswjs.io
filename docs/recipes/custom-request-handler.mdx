title: Custom request handler
---

## Use case

Creating a custom request handler is not something you would do most of the times when working with the library. However, there are cases when the usage of the standard request handlers (`rest.*`/`graphql.*`) is insufficient or inapplicable. A vibrant example of such use case is API mocking for an SDK.

When using an SDK you are provided with an interface that wraps request calls in a more domain-driven way. For example:

```js
// A random "externalSDK" package
// that allows us to list some resources.
externalSDK.listResources()
```

With SDK being an abstraction over requests, the exact method and endpoint used under the hood become its implementation details. It's highly discouraged to base your testing on such implementation details, as they are subjected to change and are not exposed publicly for a reason.

Instead, you can target a request made by an SDK by implementing a custom request matching and resolving logic with MSW.

## Request handler API

```ts
interface RequestHandler<
  RequestType,
  ContextType,
  ParsedRequest,
  PublicRequest,
  ResponseBodyType
> {
  parse?(req: RequestType): ParsedRequest | null

  predicate(req: RequestType, parsedReq: ParsedRequest): boolean

  getPublicRequest?(
    req: RequesType,
    parsedRequest: ParsedRequest,
  ): PublicRequest

  resolver: ResponseResolver

  defineContext?(req: PublicRequest): ContextType

  log(
    req: PublicRequest,
    res: ResponseWithSerializedHeaders,
    handler: RequestHandler<
      RequestType,
      ContextType,
      ParsedRequest,
      PublicRequest,
      ResponseBodyType
    >,
    parsedRequest: ParsedRequest,
  ): void
}
```

### `parse`

Parses a request, providing the result to the rest of the request handler's lifecycle methods.

Useful for deriving or normalizing request payload for the rest of the processing chain (i.e. getting an operation name, transforming body properties).

### `getPublicRequest`

Maps the captured and parsed request data to the publicly exposed `req` object in the response resolver.

Useful to expose certain parsed request information, while preserving the rest for the internal purposes. For example, you can parse GraphQL variables in the `parse` method and expose them in the `getPublicRequest` later, so they could be references under `req.variables` in the response resolver:

```js
{
  parse(req) {
    // Everything returned from the `parse` function
    // is available only internally via the `parsedRequest` object.
    return {
      variables: parseVariables(req.body)
    }
  },
  getPublicRequest(req, parsedRequest) {
    // Everything returned from the `getPublicRequest` function
    // is available publicly under the `req` object
    // in the response resolver.
    return {
      ...req,
      variables: parsedRequest.variables
    }
  }
}
```

### `predicate`

Determines whether the captured request must be responded with a mocked response.

### `resolver`

Returns a mocked response for the matched request.

### `defineContext`

Overrides the default context (`ctx`) object available in the response resolver.

Useful to provide custom [response transformers](/docs/basics/response-transformer) specific to the ...

```js
export const customHandler = (resolver) => {
  return {
    // ...predicate and other properties
    resolver,
    defineContext(req, parsedRequest) {
      return {
        resource(payload) {
          return (res) => {
            res.headers.set('content-type', 'application/json')
            res.body = {
              ...payload,
              resourceId: getRandomId(),
            }
            return res
          }
        },
      }
    },
  }
}
```

The example above would expose the `ctx.resource()` function in the response resolver, allowing for a shorthand resource creation:

```js
customHandler((req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(ctx.resource({ title: 'Random resource' }))
})
```

### `log`

Prints out the resolved request and its response to browser's console.

## Create a handler

Getting back to our SDK example, let's say that the `externalSDK.listResources()` produces the following request:

```bash showLineNumbers=false focusedLines=9
GET /sdk/resources

Headers:
  Content-Type: "application/json"

Body:
  {
    "version": "1.5",
    "operation": "ListResources",
    "region": "ua"
  }
```

When creating a custom request handler it's crucial to define reliable data for the request matching logic. As the endpoint string is an implementation detail of the SDK, the `operation` request body property is a description of the SDK method that's been invoked.

Let's create a request handler that would allow to capture requests based on their operation name:

```js
export const sdk = (operation, resolver) => {
  return {
    predicate(req) {
      // Match requests which "operation" body property
      // equals to the given "operation" string of the handler.
      const req.body.operation === operation
    },
    // Propagate the response resolver as-is.
    resolver,
    // Print out the matched request in browser's console.
    log(req, res) {
      console.log('Request', req)
      console.log('Response', res)
    }
  }
}
```

> Note that you may want to narrow down the custom `predicate` function by utilizing other request data (headers, body payload) to reduce the chance of false positive matches.

Provide the custom `sdk` request handler to the `setupWorker`/`setupServer` calls, just as you would do with the standard handlers.

```js focusedLines=5-7
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'
import { sdk } from './handlers/sdk'

const worker = setupWorker(
  sdk('ListResources', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ id: 1 }))
  }),
)

worker.start()
```
